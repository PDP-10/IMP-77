FTP-B as implemented on the ERCC DECsystem-10

It has been modified for interworking with FTP-80


The ERCC DECsystem-10  now  supports  an  implementation  of
FTP-B  as  described  in  the  document (1).  The facilities
offered in this implementation are listed below.

TRANSPORT SERVICE

Has timeout facilities.  Does not have Transport  Reset  but
does  a  clear  down  and re-initialise.  Synchronisation at
startup is done by exchanging node id's.

IMPLEMENTATION

It is implemented as a spooling system using network  tasks,
transfer  requests  being generated by a program like QUEUE.
See documents  (2)  and  (3)  for  a  description  of  these
programs.
