The IMP compiler is run by the monitor command

      .R IMP
to which the compiler responds with the prompt

      *
the command string it requires is

      * <rel-filespec> , <list-filespec> = <input-filespec>
or    * <rel-filespec> = <input-filespec>
or    * <input-filespec>

The  <filespec>s  refer  to  the  standard  DEC-10  file  specifications
namely:-

Device: filename . extension [directory list]

The directory list specification can include sub-file-directories.   The
following switches to the compiler may also be included after any of the
file specifications:-

      /CROSS  - include a cross referenced listing
                (implies a /LIST)
      /LIST   - include a listing file
      /NOCODE - syntax check only
      /NOLIST - do not include a listing file

Thus 
      .R IMP
      * FRED/CROSS/NOLIST/NOCODE

will produce a listing file called FRED.LST containing  only  the  cross
reference tables and will only do syntax checking without generating any
code.

The defaults applied to incomplete file specifications are:-
      input-filespec - DSK: filename . IMP [user]
      rel-filespec   - DSK: filename . REL [user]
      list-filespec  - DSK: filename . LST [user]

A .REL file is always produced unless suppressed by the  /NOCODE  switch
and  a listing file is only produced if asked for by the /LIST or /CROSS
switches or if a listing file specification is given.
