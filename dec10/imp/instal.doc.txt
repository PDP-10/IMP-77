The  IMP-77 compiler for TOPS-10 is contained in three passes called:
    IMP.EXE
    IMPASS.EXE
    IMPGEN.EXE
and for TOPS20 in one multi-pass file called
    IMP20.EXE

The three files (or the single file - renamed to IMP.EXE) should be mounted on
the system area together with a permanent routine file called PERMS.IMP and
the runtime library file called IMPLIB.REL.

Also enclosed are two dubugging utilities ALIST and RECODE which are described
in the run-time manual. (They require to be loaded with DIAGFS.IMP, if being
rebuilt).

In order to get the source files, it is necessary to run the program CMPRES,
which will extract the sources from the .COM files.

IMPLIB.COM     contains the runtime sytem and library
UTIL.COM       contains the utilities including alist and recode
INCLUD.COM     contains the %include files
IMPDOC.COM     contains the documentation sources.
XLIB.COM       contains additional library type functions (undocumented)

Further documentation is then obtainable in the .CTL files.
You should also read the files IMP.BWR for known shortcomings and IMP.NEW for
new features.
