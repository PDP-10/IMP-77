MAKREL is used in conjuction with RELDUM, so  that  one  can  edit  .REL
files.   The  ASCII  output  file  from RELDUM can be edited with a text
editor, and the .REL file recreated with MAKREL.   The  program  prompts
for files thus:-

.R MAKREL
Files:- output file = input file (e.g. TEST.REL = TEST.LST )

   there are no defaults allowed.
