THE NEW VERSION OF TELL DOES NOT UNFORTUNATELY, RECOGNISE TELL.INI
BUT NOW LOOKS AT SWITCH.INI. I AM SORRY IF YOU HAVE DISCOVERED THIS
ALREADY. THE WAY TO CHANGE OVER IS TO EDIT
 'TELL/GROUP:( .... )/GROUP:( ...)' INTO TELL.INI AND THEN CONCATENATE
TTY.INI ONTO THE END OF SWITCH.INI.
I AM SORRY FOR THIS OVERSIGHT, BUT I AM SURE YOU WILL FIND THE NEW
VERSION HAS A LOT OF GOOD NEW FEATURES.   KEITH FARVIS
