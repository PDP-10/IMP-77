*       <EM>long</EM> <EM>real</EM> <EM>function</EM> CPU TIME

           Returns the number of seconds of Central Processing Unit time
        used so far by the present program, offset by an arbitrary value
        X&gt;=0 which will be the same for all invocations of CPU TIME
        during the execution of a program.  The offset X might for
        example represent the CPU time between the initiation of a job
        or process and the invocation of the current program.
        Successive calls on CPU TIME through the execution of a program
        will always return results equal to or larger than their
        predecessors.  Where the host operating system does not support
        the retrieval of this information, CPU TIME will return a value
        of zero.  Note that the times returned by CPU TIME may or may
        not include processing performed by the operating system and
        charged for some reason to the present program, but that where
        the host operating system provides access to CPU TIME including
        and excluding system overhead, the preferred result is that
        excluding system overhead.


*       <EM>string</EM>(255) <EM>function</EM> DATE

           This function returns the current date in the host operating
        system's textual representation.  Programs should make no
        assumption about the length or internal structure of this
        string.  Where the host operating system does not support the
        retrieval of this information, DATE will return the null string.


*       <EM>string</EM>(255) <EM>function</EM> TIME

           This function returns the current time of day in the host
        operating system's textual representation.  Programs should make
        no assumption about the length or internal structure of this
        string.  Where the host operating system does not support the
        retrieval of this information, TIME will return the null string.
