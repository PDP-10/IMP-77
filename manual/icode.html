                                   <H2>1   Philosophy</H2>

        I-code is an intermediate code used to provide an interface  between
        the   machine-independent   and   machine-dependent  sections  of  a
        compiler.

        Most intermediate codes in use today describe the  execution  of  an
        abstract  machine  which  performs  the  desired  computation.   For
        example, the intermediate code for a statement of the form:  X = Y+Z
        would  describe  the  operations of the abstract machine which would
        compute the value of Y+Z and assign it to X.   Using  this  sort  of
        code  the  machine-dependent  section of the compiler has to map the
        abstract machine onto the real target machine.

        I-code uses a  fundamentally  different  model.   It  describes  the
        execution  of  an  abstract  compiler which generates target code to
        perform the desired computation; it does not  describe  an  abstract
        machine  which  will  perform  that  computation.   It  is  vital to
        understand that it does not describe the  function  of  the  program
        directly but describes it indirectly via the abstract compiler.   It
        is  this  indirection  which  gives   I-code   the   power   to   be
        machine-independent without sacrificing efficiency in the executable
        programs which it can be used to generate.

        There are two important corollaries of this.  Firstly the structures
        and  operations  associated  with the abstract compiler need have no
        counterparts in the object program.   For example the target machine
        need  have  no hardware or software stack and neither need it have a
        true condition code.   Secondly the code assumes that the operations
        it describes will be performed by the abstract compiler in the order
        specified  with  no  omissions.   In particular the control transfer
        instructions do not transfer control in the  abstract  compiler  but
        indicate  changes  of  control  flow  in  the program which is being
        compiled.   This also does not mean that any of the operations  need
        have  counterparts  in  the object program nor that the order of the
        generated code need correspond to the order of the I-code.

        For example the Algol-60 statement: <TT>A := if B then C else  D;</TT>  could
        not be encoded in the seemingly obvious way:
<PRE>
           Stack A
           Stack B;  Test-Boolean;  BF 1
           Stack C;  Forward 2
           Label 1
           Stack D
           Label 2
           Assign-Value
</PRE>
        as  this  would assign D to C, the last two objects stacked prior to
        the Assign-Value instruction, and leave A on the stack.

         condition-code
                       A  conceptual  flag  which  is set at run-time by the
                       instructions listed in Appendix 2.   This  flag  need
                       not  exist  in  the target machine must is defined in
                       order  to  simplify  the   definitions   of   certain
                       instructions.   The  values  which this flag may take
                       are:
                          equal, less than, greater than, true, false
                       This setting only remains valid for the  duration  of
                       the  next  instruction  which  must  be  one  of  the
                       instructions listed in Appendix 3.

         integer       A  general  integer  value,  including  subranges  of
                       integers.

         labels        I-code distinguishes two sorts of label.

                       1.   Simple  labels  have  the property that they are
                       only  jumped  to  in  one  direction,  that  is,  all
                       references  to  an  instance  of  a  simple label are
                       either all forward or all backward.   This means that
                       the  same  denotation  may  be  used  for many simple
                       labels.  For example the following is valid:
                          Forward 1   &gt;-----+
                          ...                |
                          Label 1     &lt;-----+
                          ...
                          Forward 1   &gt;-----+
                          ...                |
                          Label 1     &lt;-----+
                          ...
                          Label 1     &lt;-----+
                          ...                |
                          Backward 1  &gt;-----+

                       All uses of a particular simple label must be in  the
                       same block as the definition of that label.

                       Simple   labels  are  encoded  as  two-byte  unsigned
                       integers although  code  generators  may  assume  the
                       their  values  are within a fairly small range; 1..50
                       is common.

                       2.   General labels have none of the restrictions  of
                       simple labels.   They are identified by tags and will
                       be defined automatically if necessary when  they  are
                       first  used.   General  labels  are referenced by the
                       instructions:
                          Jump &lt;tag&gt;
                          Locate &lt;tag&gt;
                          Stack &lt;tag&gt;

         real          A  floating-point  value,  either  single  or  double
                       precision.

         SOS           The second-top item on the stack.

         stack         A  first-in,  last-out  structure  used  to imply the
                       operands required  by  various  I-code  instructions.
                       The first item which can be removed from the stack is
                       called  TOS  and  the item which can be removed after
                       TOS is called SOS.

         tags          Tags are definitions  of  objects  which  are  to  be
                       manipulated  by the compiler.   These definitions are
                       created in a nested fashion; all tags  defined  in  a
                       block  are  deleted  when  the  end  of that block is
                       reached.    On  definition  the   machine-independent
                       description  of  the  object  is  converted  into the
                       appropriate  machine-dependent  description  of   the
                       actual  object to be used.   Within this document the
                       term 'tag' is used to describe both  this  descriptor
                       and the unsigned sixteen-bit integer used as an index
                       value  to  select it from the collection of all tags.
                       With the  exception  of  the  resolution  of  forward
                       references  to  procedures,  tags  are never altered.
                       When a copy of a tag value is pushed onto  the  stack
                       the value becomes known as a descriptor.  Descriptors
                       may be modified.

         tag list      is  an  ordered  sequence  of tag definitions used to
                       describe  either  the  parameters   required   by   a
                       procedure or the fields of a record.  Components of a
                       tag  list  are referred to either explicitly by their
                       position in the list (see SELECT)  or  implicitly  by
                       sequence starting with the first to be specified (see
                       Assign-Parameter).

         TOS           The top item on the stack.

         list flag     An  internal  flag which is set during the processing
                       of explicit  lists  of  tag  definitions.   Its  only
                       purpose is to prevent certain nested list structures.

<UL>
         <LI>1.    It  is  assumed  that  the  reader  is  familiar with the IMP
               language and its terminology.

         <LI>2.    Whenever a pointer-variable is used in the context of a value
               the value of the data item pointed to will be used.

         <LI>3.    In  general,  diagnostic  checks  are  implied  rather   than
               explicitly specified.

         <LI>4.    Items  on the stack are intended to be 'rules for generating'
               values or references rather than  the  values  or  references
               themselves.   For simplicity the descriptions of instructions
               will often refer to items as if they actually contain  values
               or references.

         <LI>5.    By  convention  tag  index  values  will often be replaced in
               examples by the identifier which  is  assumed  to  have  been
               associated with the tag in question.

               For  example,  given  '<TT>DEFINE 57,Fred</TT>......'  then '<TT>Stack 57</TT>'
               could be written '<TT>Stack Fred</TT>'

         <LI>6.    The term 'error' is used to indicate a  condition  discovered
               by  the code-generator which should terminate the compilation
               with a suitable error message.

<H2>4   Instructions</H2>

<PRE>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Absolute</font>

         Effect:       TOS is replaced by the absolute value of TOS.

         Errors:       1. The stack is empty.
                       2. TOS is not integer or real.

         Example:      X = |Y+Z|
                       Stack X;   Stack Y;  Stack Z;  Add
                       Absolute;  Assign-Value

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Access</font>

         Effect:       TOS is used as the final  index  into  SOS.   TOS  is
                       removed from the stack leaving SOS as the new TOS.

         Notes:        This   instruction  is  used  to  process  the  final
                       dimension of an N dimensional array.   See Index  for
                       the previous dimensions.

         Errors:       1. The stack contains less than two items.
                       2. TOS is not an integer value.
                       3. SOS does not describe an array.

         Example:      A(j) = 0
                       Stack A;  Stack j;  Access
                       Byte 0;   Assign-Value

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Add</font>

         Effect:       TOS and SOS are removed from the stack and a new item
                       describing the sum of the their values, SOS + TOS, is
                       stacked.   Integer  values  will  be  converted  into
                       floating-point if one  operand  is  integer  and  the
                       other is real.

         Errors:       1. The stack contains less than two items.
                       2. TOS (or SOS) is neither integer nor real type.

         Example:      A = B + C
                       Stack A;  Stack B;  Stack C;  Add;  Assign-Value


<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Address</font>

         Effect:       TOS  is  replaced  by  the  address  of the object it
                       describes.

         Notes:        Commonly   the   type   of   an   address   will   be
                       indistinguishable from integer.

         Errors:       1. The stack is empty.
                       2. TOS does not have an address.

         Example:      P = Addr(Q)
                       Stack P;  Stack Q;  Address;  Assign-Value

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Adjust</font>

         Effect:       The  address of SOS is adjusted forwards or backwards
                       by TOS items of the same size as SOS.   This  may  be
                       thought  of  as  an array accessing instruction where
                       SOS defines the zero'th element.

         Errors:       1. The stack contains less than two items.
                       2. TOS is not an integer.
                       3. SOS does not reference a data object.

         Example:      N == N[X]
                       Stack N;  Stack N;  Stack X
                       Adjust;  Assign-Reference

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Alias &lt;string&gt;</font>

         Effect:       &lt;string&gt; is noted as the current alias.

         Note:         See 'Begin' and 'Define'

         Errors:       None

         Example:      <B>external</B> <B>integer</B> Thing <B>alias</B> "SS$THING"
                       Alias "SS$THING"
                       Define THING..........

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Alt-Start</font>

         Effect:       This instruction marks the start  of  an  alternative
                       sequence of tag definitions.

         Note:         The   instructions   Alt-Start   and  Alt-Finish  are
                       brackets and must be properly nested.

         Error:        1. List flag is not set.

         Example:


                       <B>recordformat</B> F(<B>integer</B> X, (<B>integer</B> Y <B>or</B> <B>real</B> Z))
                       Define F.......
                       Start
                          Define X.....
                          Alt-Start
                             Define Y.....
                          Next-Alt
                             Define Z.....
                          Alt-Finish
                       Finish

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Alt-Finish</font>

         Effect:       This  instruction  marks  the  end  of  a   list   of
                       alternatives.

         Notes:        Alt-Start and Alt-Finish must be properly nested.

         Errors:       1. List flag is not set.
                       2. There has been no unmatched Alt-Start instruction.

         Example:

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> And</font>

         Effect:       TOS  and  SOS  are  removed  from  the  stack and the
                       logical AND of their values, SOS &amp; TOS, is stacked.

         Errors:       1. The stack contains less than two items.
                       2. TOS and SOS are not both integer values.

         Example:      A = B &amp; C
                       Stack A;  Stack B;  Stack C;  And;  Assign-Value

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Assign-Parameter</font>

         Effect:       TOS is passed as the next parameter to SOS.   TOS  is
                       removed from the stack leaving SOS as the new TOS.

         Note:         Parameters  must  be  specified  in  the order of the
                       definition of the parameter list.   If the  parameter
                       list  is  empty  the  occurence  of  this instruction
                       implies that the procedure has a variable  number  of
                       parameters  and so the parameters are to be passed in
                       a  C-like  manner;  this  also  requires   that   the
                       procedure   be   called   using   the   Variable-Call
                       instruction.

         Errors:       1. The stack contains less than two items.
                       2. SOS is not a procedure descriptor.
                       3. TOS is unsuitable for this parameter.

         Example:      J = Calc(1, K)
                       Stack J;  Stack Calc
                       Byte 1;   Assign-Parameter

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Assign-Value</font>

         Effect:       The value  of  TOS  is  assigned  to  the  data  item
                       referenced by SOS.  Both TOS and SOS are removed from
                       the stack.

         Notes:        Integer   values   will   be  converted  to  real  if
                       necessary.

         Error:        1. The stack contains less than two items.

         Example:      A = B+C
                       Stack A;  Stack B;  Stack C;  Add;  Assign-Value

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Assign-Reference</font>

         Effect:       The pointer variable referenced by  SOS  is  made  to
                       point  at  the variable referenced by TOS.   Both TOS
                       and SOS are removed from the stack.

         Errors:       1. The stack contains less than two items.
                       2. SOS is not a reference to a pointer variable.
                       3. TOS is not a reference to a variable.
                       4. The types of TOS and SOS are different.

         Example:      P == Q
                       Stack P;  Stack Q;  Assign-Reference

         Effect:       An  anonymous  procedure  is  defined here and called
                       once.  A new block is entered.   If an alias has been
                       noted  (see  Alias)  that  string  will  be  used for
                       identifying  the  block  in  diagnostic   information
                       leaving no alias noted.

         Notes:        The   sequence   "Begin ...... End"   may  always  be
                       replaced by a sequence of the form:

         Note:         &lt;label&gt; must refer to a simple label  which  must  be
                       defined  somewhere  after the BT instruction, that is
                       BT can only specify  a  forward  jump  (although  the
                       object program may use a backward jump).

         Example:      if not B then P := Q
                       Stack B;  Test-Boolean
                       BT 12

                       Label 12

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Byte &lt;b&gt;</font>

         Effect:       The unsigned byte value &lt;b&gt; is stacked.

         Notes:        This  is  a  compact form for the Integer instruction
                       when small values are to be stacked.

         Errors:       None

         Example:      X = 200
                       Stack X;  Byte 200;  Assign-Value

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Call</font>

         Effect:       The procedure described by TOS is called.   If TOS is
                       a procedure which returns a result TOS is replaced by
                       that result, otherwise TOS is removed from the stack.

         Notes:        Predicates  do  not  return  a  result  but  set  the
                       condition-code.

         Errors:       1. The stack is empty.
                       2. TOS does not describe a procedure.
                       3. There has not been the same number  of  parameters
                          assigned using Assign-Parameter as is specified by
                          the parameter list.

         Example:      Newline
                       Stack Newlines;  Byte 4;  Assign-Parameter;  Call

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Compare-References</font>

         Effect:       The  address of SOS is compared to the address of TOS
                       and the condition-code is set appropriately.  TOS and
                       SOS are then removed from the stack.

         Errors:       1. The stack contains less than two items.
                       2. TOS or SOS is not a reference for a data object.

         Example:      <B>integername</B> M; <B>integer</B> N
                       <B>if</B> N == M <B>then</B> Newline

                       Stack N;  Stack M;  Compare-References
                       BNE 14
                       Stack Newline;  Call
                       Label 14


<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Compare-Repeated-Values</font>

         Effect:       SOS is compared to TOS and the condition-code is  set
                       appropriately.   SOS  is  then removed from the stack
                       leaving TOS.

         Notes:        The types of both TOS and SOS  must  be  one  of  the
                       following four:
                          Integer or Real
                          String
                          Record
                          Set
                       Integer  values  will  be  converted  to  real if one
                       operand is real.

         Errors:       1. The stack contains less than two items.
                       2. The types of TOS and SOS are incompatible.

         Example:      <B>if</B> 1 &lt;= X &lt;= 12 <B>then</B> X = 0
                       Byte 1;  Stack X;  Compare-Repeated-Values
                       BGT 15
                       Byte 12;  Compare-Values
                       BGT 15
                       Stack X;  Byte 0;  Assign-Values
                       Label 15

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Compare-Unsigned-Values</font>

         Effect:       SOS is compared against TOS  with  the  values  being
                       interpreted  as unsigned values.   The condition-code
                       is set accordingly and TOS and SOS are  removed  from
                       the stack

         Errors:       1. The stack contains less than two items.
                       2.  TOS and SOS are not both integer values.

         Example:      <B>if</B> U1 &lt; U2 <B>then</B> U2 = 0
                       Stack U1;  Stack U2;  Compare-Unsigned-Values
                       Bge 31
                       Stack U2;  Byte 0;  Assign-Value
                       Label 31

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Compare-Values</font>

         Effect:       SOS  is compared to TOS and the condition-code is set
                       appropriately.  TOS and SOS are then removed from the
                       stack.

         Notes:        The types of both TOS and SOS  must  be  one  of  the
                       following four:
                          Integer or Real
                          String
                          Record
                          Set
                       Integer   values   will   be  converted  to  real  if
                       necessary.
                       The comparison is signed  where  integer  values  are
                       concerned.

         Errors:       1. The stack contains less than two items.
                       2. The types of TOS and SOS are incompatible.

         Example:      <B>if</B> S &lt; "123" <B>then</B> X = 0
                       Stack S;  String "123";  Compare-Values
                       BGE 13
                       Stack X;  Byte 0;  Assign-Values
                       Label 13

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Complement</font>

         Effect:       TOS is replaced by the ones-complement of TOS.

         Errors:       1. The stack is empty
                       2. TOS is not an integer value.

         Example:      P = \Q
                       Stack P;  Stack Q;  Complement;  Assign-Value

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Concat</font>

         Effect:       TOS  and  SOS  are  removed  from  the  stack and the
                       concatenation of their values, SOS.TOS, is stacked.

         Errors:       1. The stack contains less than two values.
                       2. TOS and SOS are not both string values.

         Example:      S = T.U.V
                       Stack S
                       Stack T;  Stack U;  Concat
                       Stack V;  Concat
                       Assign-Value

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Control &lt;n&gt;</font>

         Effect:       The value  &lt;n&gt;  is  considered  to  be  of  the  form
                       p&lt;&lt;14+q.   The value q is to be used by the p'th pass
                       of the compiler in an implementation-specific manner.

         Errors:       None

         Effect:       A new tag value is created.

                       &lt;tag&gt; defines the tag index which  will  be  used  to
                             select the value.

                       [id]  specifies the actual identifier associated with
                             the described object.  It is a sequence of zero
                             or more characters terminated by a comma.  This
                             identifier will be used for external linkage if
                             necessary  unless  overridden by an Alias. [id]
                             will  also  be  used  for  run-time  diagnostic
                             information.

                       &lt;a&gt;   A two-byte value: &lt;a&gt; = T&lt;&lt;4+F where:

                       &lt;b&gt;   If   T  is  INTEGER  &lt;b&gt;  takes  the  following
                             meanings:

                                         3, range -32768..32767

                             If T is REAL &lt;b&gt; takes the following meanings:

                             &lt;b&gt; =       1, normal precision
                                         4, double precision

                             If T is STRING &lt;b&gt; gives the maximum length  of
                             the string.
                             If  T  is  RECORD  &lt;b&gt;  gives  the  tag  of the
                             corresponding recordformat.
                             If T is enumerated &lt;b&gt; gives  the  tag  of  the
                             dummy  format  used  to identify the enumerated
                             value identifiers.

                       &lt;c&gt;   is a two-byte value: U&lt;&lt;5+I&lt;&lt;4+S&lt;&lt;3+X where:
                                U is 1 check the object for unassigned
                                     0 otherwise
                                I is 1 if the object is an indirect object,
                                     0 otherwise
                                S is 1 if this is a <B>spec</B>,
                                     0 otherwise
                                X  = 0 :: automatic (stack) allocation
                                     1 :: <B>own</B>

                                     4 :: <B>system</B>
                                     5 :: <B>dynamic</B>

                                     7 :: <B>permanent</B>

                             An indirect object (I=1) differs  from  F=2  in
                             that F=2 implies that the actual object created
                             will  be  a  pointer  and  will be dereferenced
                             whenever used unless explicit action  is  taken
                             (e.g.  use  of  Assign-Reference).   If  I=1  a
                             pointer will be created (usually as an integer)
                             and will be treated as an integer (or  address)
                             with no automatic dereferencing taking place.

         Notes:        The  tag  values  within  a block should be dense and
                       preferably consecutive.   All  tag  values  within  a
                       block  must  have values greater than the maximum tag
                       value yet defined within the enclosing block.
                       Tag definitions remain valid until  the  end  of  the
                       enclosing block.
                       The  tag values used within a recordformat definition
                       must all be zero; the fields of a record are selected
                       by their position in the  format,  numbered  starting
                       from one.

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Define-Range &lt;tag&gt;</font>

         Effect:       The  given  tag  is  defined  to be the integer range
                       defined by lower-bound and upper-bound.

         Error:        1. The two bounds have not been defined.

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Diagnose &lt;n&gt;</font>

         Effect:       The value  &lt;n&gt;  is  considered  to  be  of  the  form
                       p&lt;&lt;14+q.   The value q is to be used by the p'th pass
                       of the compiler in an implementation-specific manner.

         Errors:       None


<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Dimension &lt;n&gt;&lt;d&gt;</font>

         Effect:       &lt;d&gt; pairs of integer values on the stack are used  to
                       define the bounds of the last &lt;n&gt; arrays to have been
                       defined.    Code   is  generated,  if  necessary,  to
                       allocate the arrays and the definitions are  adjusted
                       to reference the appropriate storage.

         Notes:        The  pairs  of  values  are  stacked  in order of the
                       declaration, that is, first dimension first.
                       In each pair of values the  lower  bound  is  stacked
                       before the upper bound.
                       The  last  &lt;n&gt;  tags  must have had consecutive index
                       values.

         Errors:       1. The stack contains less than 2*&lt;d&gt; items.
                       2. The last &lt;n&gt; definitions were not all arrays.

         Example:      <B>integerarray</B> A, B, C(1:2, Low:4)
                       Define A......
                       Define B......

                       Dimension 3 2

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Div</font>

         Effect:       TOS and SOS are removed from the stack and  the  real
                       quotient, SOS / TOS, is stacked.  Integer values will
                       be  converted into floating-point before the division
                       is attempted.

         Errors:       1. The stack contains less than two items.
                       2. TOS (or SOS) is neither integer nor real type.

         Example:      A = B / C
                       Stack A;  Stack B;  Stack C;  Div;  Assign-Value

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Duplicate</font>

         Effect:       A copy of TOS is pushed onto the stack.

         Note:         After this instruction TOS and SOS are identical.

         Error:        1. The stack is empty.

         Example:      int A[10],x;
                       A[x]++;

                       Stack A;  Stack x;  Adjust

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> End</font>

         Effect:       This instruction marks the end of a block.   All tags
                       defined within the block are deleted (made undefined)
                       and  become available for re-use.   If the block is a
                       <B>routine</B> this  instruction  also  implies  a  'Return'
                       instruction.

         Error:        1. The stack is not empty.


<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> End-Of-File</font>

         Effect:       The  compilation  is  to  be  abandoned with an error
                       message.

         Notes:        This instruction is required at the end of an  I-code
                       file even though in correct programs it will never be
                       executed.   It  is  there  to  provide a check on the
                       operation of the code-generator  and  to  permit  the
                       code-generator to use a one-character look-ahead.

         Errors:       None


<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Eval</font>

         Effect:       The value described by TOS is protected against being
                       altered  as  the  side-effect  of  alterations to any
                       variables which make up that value.

         Notes:        Commonly this instruction loads the value of TOS into
                       a machine register.

         Error:        1. The stack is empty.

         Example:      a = b + c++
                       Stack a;  Stack b;  Stack c;  Add
                       Eval

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Eval-Addr</font>

         Effect:       The  address  of  the  object  described  by  TOS  is
                       protected against alteration.

         Notes:        Commonly  this  instruction  loads the address of the
                       object refered to be TOS into a machine register.

         Errors:       1. The stack is empty.
                       2. TOS is not a reference.

         Example:      int *p;
                       *p++ = 10;

                       Stack p;  Eval-Addr;  Stack p;  Duplicate
                       Byte 1;  Adjust;  Assign-Value
                       Byte 10;  Assign-Value

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Finish</font>

         Effect:       This instruction marks the  end  of  a  list  of  tag
                       definitions  corresponding to either a parameter list
                       or a recordformat definition.   List flag is  cleared
                       and  the tag list is processed in any ways necessary.
                       If the tag list is associated with a  procedure  spec
                       or  a  recordformat  this  instruction also marks the
                       'end' of the associated 'block'.

         Note:         The list of definitions may be empty.

         Errors:       1. List flag is clear.
                       2. There has been an unmatched Alt-Start.

         Examples:     <B>routine</B> Test(<B>integer</B> j,k)
                       Define Test.........
                       Start
                          Define j......
                          Define k......

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Float</font>

         Effect:       The value described by TOS is converted into  a  real
                       value if necessary.

         Notes:        If TOS is already a real this operation is a no-op.

         Errors:       1. The stack is empty.
                       2. TOS is neither integer nor real.

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> For &lt;label&gt;</font>

         Effect:       This  instruction marks the start of a FOR statement.
                       &lt;label&gt; is the label to be jumped to  on  <B>repeat</B>  and
                       &lt;label+1&gt; is the label to be jumped to on an <B>exit</B>.

         Notes:        The corresponding <B>repeat</B> will be the next instruction
                       of the form: Backward &lt;label&gt;.
                       &lt;label+1&gt;  should  only  be defined explicitly if the
                       loop contains an explicit <B>exit</B> instruction.

         Errors:       1. The stack contains less than four items.
                       2. The top three items on the stack are  not  integer
                          values.
                       3. The fourth item on the stack is not a reference to
                          an integer variable.
                       4. No  Backward &lt;label&gt; instruction occurs before the
                          end of the current block.

         Example:      A(j) = 0 <B>for</B> J = 1, 1, N
                       Stack J;  Byte 1;  Byte 1;  Stack N

                       Backward 40

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Forward &lt;label&gt;</font>

         Effect:       Control is  transferred  forward  unconditionally  to
                       &lt;label&gt;

         Error:        1. &lt;label&gt;   does   not   get   defined  by  a  Label
                          instruction before the end of the current block.

         Example:      <B>if</B> X=0 <B>then</B> Y=1 <B>else</B> Y=2
                       Stack X;  Byte 0;  Compare-Values;  Bne 20

                       Label 21

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Include &lt;string&gt;</font>

         Effect:       This instruction marks the start (or end) of the code
                       generated from source contained in an  include  file.
                       If  &lt;string&gt;  is  null it marks the end of an include
                       file.

         Errors:       None


<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Index</font>

         Effect:       TOS is used as the  next  index  into  SOS.   TOS  is
                       removed from the stack leaving SOS as the new TOS.

         Notes:        This  instruction  is  used  to process the first N-1
                       dimensions of an N dimensional array.  See Access for
                       the final dimension.

         Errors:       1. The stack contains less than two items.
                       2. TOS is not an intger value.
                       3. SOS is not an array descriptor.


<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Init &lt;n&gt;</font>

         Effect:       &lt;n&gt; copies of the init-value are added to the list of
                       values  associated  with  the   init-variable.    The
                       init-value  is  either the default value (unassigned)
                       if the stack is empty, the  value  of  TOS  (possibly
                       converted  to  real)  if  TOS  is  a constant, or the
                       address  of  TOS  if  TOS   is   a   variable.    The
                       init-variable  is the last static object to have been
                       defined using Define.

         Error:        1. TOS, if it exists, is not of the same type as  the
                          init-variable.

         Examples:     <B>ownintegerarray</B> A(1:5) = 1(3), 4, 99
                       Byte 1;  Byte 5;  Bounds

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Init-Type &lt;n&gt;</font>

         Effect:       The   type   of   the  init-variable  (see  Init)  is
                       considered to be &lt;n&gt; for the purposes  of  subsequent
                       'Init'  instructions.  &lt;n&gt; encodes the type as in the
                       type field of 'Define'.

         Errors:       1. &lt;n&gt; does not correspond to a valid type.


<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Int</font>

         Effect:       TOS is replaced by Int(TOS),  that  is,  the  nearest
                       integer to the value of TOS.  The type of the new TOS
                       is integer.

         Notes:        See  the  IMP  Library Definition for a discussion of
                       the details of the INT function.

         Errors:       1. The stack is empty.
                       2. TOS is neither integer nor real.

         Example:      I = Int(R+0.3)
                       Stack I;  Stack R;  Real &lt;0.3&gt;;  Add
                       Int
                       Assign-Value

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Intpt</font>

         Effect:       TOS is replaced by Intpt(TOS), that is,  the  integer
                       part of TOS.  The type of the new TOS is integer.

         Notes:        See  the  IMP  Library Definition for a discussion of
                       the details of the INTPT function.

         Errors:       1. The stack is empty.
                       2. TOS is neither integer nor real value.

         Example:      I = Intpt(R-S)
                       Stack I;  Stack R;  Stack S;  Sub
                       Intpt

         Effect:       TOS and SOS are removed from the stack and the  value
                       of  SOS  raised  to the integer power of the value of
                       TOS, SOS^^TOS, is stacked.

         Errors:       1. The stack contains less than two items.
                       2. TOS and SOS are not integer values.

         Example:      J = K^^3
                       Stack J;  Stack K;  Byte 3;  Integer-Power
                       Assign-Value

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Jump &lt;tag&gt;</font>

         Effect:       Control is transferred unconditionally to the general
                       label &lt;tag&gt;.

         Notes:        This control transfer may pass over block boundaries.

         Errors:       1. &lt;tag&gt; is defined but is not a general label.
                       2. &lt;tag&gt; is undefined but does not become defined  in
                          a suitable block before the end of the program.  A
                          suitable  block  is  one  which is either the same
                          block as the Jump instruction or is a block  which
                          properly contains that instruction.

         Example:            X = 1
                       Pos:  Y = Y+1
                             -&gt;Pos <B>if</B> Y < 0

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Label &lt;label&gt;</font>

         Effect:       The  simple label &lt;label&gt; is defined to be here.   If
                       outstanding references to the label  exist  they  are
                       satisfied  and the label ceases to be defined.   This
                       ensures that all references to this label are in  the
                       same direction.

         Errors:       None

         Example:      S = "**" <B>if</B> S = ""
                       Stack S;  String "**";  Compare-Values
                       Bne 26

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Sub</font>

         Effect:       TOS  and SOS are removed from the stack and the value
                       of SOS minus the value of TOS, SOS - TOS, is stacked.
                       Integer values will be converted into  floating-point
                       if one operand is integer and the other is real.

         Errors:       1. The stack contains less than two items.
                       2. TOS (or SOS) is neither integer nor real type.

                       3. TOS is not an integer value within the  bounds  of
                          &lt;tag&gt;.

         Example:      Sw(12):
                       Byte 12;  Switch-Label Sw

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Swop</font>

         Effect:       The  top  two items on the stack are reversed.   That
                       is, TOS becomes the new SOS, and SOS becomes the  new
                       TOS.

         Error:        1. The stack contains less than two items.

         Example:      X = Y

         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Test-Nil</font>

         Effect:       A  check  is performed to ensure that TOS is not NIL.
                       An event is signalled if it is, or if TOS points to a
                       heap  item  which  has  been  returned  to  the  heap
                       (disposed).

         Notes:        This  test  can  also  perform an unassigned variable
                       check.

         Errors:       1. The stack is empty.
                       2. TOS is not a pointer variable.

         Example:      P^ := 0;

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Test-Range &lt;tag&gt;</font>

         Effect:       The value of TOS is checked to be  within  the  range
                       defined by the tag.  If the value is not in the range
                       an event is signalled.

         Notes:        The event is signalled at run-time.

         Errors:       1. The stack is empty.
                       2. TOS is not an integer value.
                       3. &lt;tag&gt; does not define a range.

         Example:      Byteval := Bigval;

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Trunc</font>

         Effect:       TOS  is  replaced by the value TRUNC(TOS) where TRUNC
                       is as  defined  in  section  6.6.6.3  of  the  Pascal
                       standard  BS 6192:1982, with the extension that Trunc
                       returns the value of its parameter if that  value  is
                       already an integer.

         Errors:       1. The stack is empty.
                       2. TOS is neither integer nor real.

         Example:      i := Trunc(r+0.1);

<HR>
         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Variable-Call</font>

         Effect:       The  procedure  described  by  TOS  is called.   This
                       differs from 'Call' in that the procedure may have  a
                       variable number of parameters.

         Notes:        This  instruction  is used to call 'C' procedures and
                       its definition is as wooly as the definition of  that
                       language.

         Errors:       1. The stack is empty.
                       2. TOS is not a procedure descriptor.

         Instruction: <font color=#ff0000> Xor</font>

         Effect:       TOS  and SOS are removed from the stack and the value
                       of SOS  exclusively  ORed  with  the  value  of  TOS,
                       SOS !! TOS, is stacked.

         Errors:       1. The stack contains less than two items.
                       2. TOS and SOS are not both integer values.

         Example:      A = B !!  C
                       Stack A;  Stack B;  Stack C;  Xor;  Assign-Value
